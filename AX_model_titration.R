## AX titration model

# 2021/01/21 This script models AX titrations, and realistic uncertainties
# will be added to various parts of the titration. This includes scatter un
# the dosimat, and carbonate and silicate contamination of the titrants
# (primarily NaOH). The data output will be formatted the same as the
# output files from my Labview program

# 2021/01/26 Working on the titration part of the code (not th equilibrium
# so far). I need to figure out a better naming system for the two weight
# vectors.

# 2021/01/27 I believe I have the whole code working, last thing is
# figuring out the file naming structure which should be part of the
# function input. Smaller increment size is needed to simulate -Cl solutions!

# 2021/01/28 There is an issue with the code. Especially at low pH, when I
# interpret my data (BWD), there is an obvious scatter that diminishes at
# higher pH values. Probably because the change is very small for each
# increment? I don't know, anyways, when I interpret the data the scatter
# becomes clear. I think it has to do with what solver I use and how I set
# it up, like ther eare just so many solutions and guess/number of
# iterations matters. Maybe I can make it a scale problem? Not sure. Brain
# tired. Will look at it tomorrow. There is currently no other noise added
# into the system, so it must be coming from the interpretation. -MLP

# 2021/01/29 The scatter at low pH was NOT caused by the solver, it was
# caused by me saving the variables in .csv file and specifying only 6
# decimal points. Once I upped this to 15, the scatter disappeared!
# (Thanks Mike!).

# 2021/02/01 I added for H+ in the ChemEq to be on the total scale, meaning
# that the appropriate acid-bases are corrected to free-scale if their
# constants require it, but most are not. This by adding a factor, Z,
# according to Dickson et al. 2003. This should work for NaCl and KCl
# solutions as well, because their ST is zero and Z will therefor be 1.
# -MLP

# 2021/02/02 Finally fixed the issue that was interpretation code not
# giving me the AT and E0 I put in â€“ in my titration code I had reduced CT
# from initial to "removed" value one line too late, so the first titration
# point still had 2000 umol/kg CT left in it. I could see this even on the
# gran plot, so I should have understood that the issue was related to the
# first 3.5 titration point. Oh well, de-gassed CT was moved to the
# appropriate place and I can keep working on the BWD parts of the two
# codes. -MLP

# 2021/04/23 I want to update my code so I don't input AT, but rather sums
# up AT and excludes AX? Or, what do I really need here. For now perhaps
# make the code so it's quick and easy for me to use. Worry about adding
# user friendly stuff later. I do want it as a function though, and I'd
# like to do something similar with the interpretation code.

# 2021/5/09 Started adding uncertainties in a random way (I hope) so I can
# run many in a Monte Carlo type simulation, and get an average and
# standard deviation for the LOD and "0 AX signal". -MLP
